# Textures_V1


Here are the initial texture pngs used for the later tile mapping of the game. I have created 3 textures for each subject (Grass/Mud/Dirt/Tree Foliage) where you guys can decided what we should use, but also what I could change for future renditions. All png files are 256x256 seamless with the intention in mind that I'll most likely go back to them and create additional connecting tiles and textures. Any thoughts and critiques are welcomed.
